Since real-world port operational data is confidential, I've created a simulated dataset for this project. I researched typical characteristics of container vessel calls, cargo types, port infrastructure (like number of cranes per berth), labor assignments, and environmental factors by consulting publicly available port authority statistics, maritime industry reports from organizations like Alphaliner or Drewry, news articles on port operations and congestion, and meteorological data patterns for coastal regions.

Using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries, I generated a dataset of 5000 [Number of Samples] historical vessel calls. For each call, I included features like vessel size, planned cargo volume (TEU, including reefer/hazmat counts), assigned resources (cranes, gang size), relevant weather conditions (wind, precipitation), and pre-berth waiting time. The target variable, 'Actual_Operation_Duration_Hours', was simulated based on these factors, incorporating realistic relationships and some inherent variability, drawing on industry benchmarks for crane productivity (e.g., moves per hour per crane) to ensure the durations are plausible. I also intentionally introduced some missing values to simulate real-world data imperfections.

This dataset, while synthetic, captures the key variables and complexities I'd expect to see in actual port operational data and allows me to demonstrate the full data science workflow, from handling raw data to building a predictive model for operational efficiency.
